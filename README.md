Implementation of a complete shell from scratch

The shell is implemented in C and is meant to be an easy implementation of it, providing the basic functions that a shell normally has.
This shell is an open source side project developed by Lamberto Ragnolini in the Fall semester 2024.

The main features of it are the ability of handling the built in functions cd and echo in addition with all the executables present in your system.
The prompt is custom for my shell but by changing the name in the script under the shell_name variables you will be able to have *YOUR OWN PERSONAL PROMPT*

The shell provides the fiollowing features:
builtin function :
  - cd -> change directory
  - executables :
    i.e ls, ls-l , cat etc...
  - clear :
    clear command that clears the screen for linux users

The shell has no :
  - foreground/background processes
  - history
  - other builtin commands other than cd and echo
