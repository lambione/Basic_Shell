Implementation of a complete shell from scratch

The shell is implemented in C and takes into account all the possible functionalities a normal shell provides.
This specific shell will provide additional custom features to provide a better flow in the use and to ease the user in some tasks.

For the moment the shell provides the fiollowing features:
builtin function :
cd -> change directory
executables :
i.e ls, ls-l , cat etc...
clear :
clear command that clears the screen for linux users
open :
it is implemented for all kind of OS's

The shell is in development but everyone that would like to use some parts of the code is kindly requested to provide credit to the author.
